In this lecture, we will introduce the ERC20 token standard on Ethereum and issue our test tokens.

## ERC20

ERC20 is a token standard on Ethereum, which originated from the `EIP20` proposed by Vitalik Buterin in November 2015. It implements the basic logic of token transfer:

- Account balance
- Transfer
- Approve transfer
- Total token supply
- Token Information (optional): name, symbol, decimal

## IERC20
`IERC20` is the interface contract of the `ERC20` token standard, which specifies the functions and events that `ERC20` tokens need to implement. The reason for defining an interface is that with the standard, there are universal function names and input and output parameters for all `ERC20` tokens. In the interface functions, only the function name, input parameters, and output parameters need to be defined, and it does not matter how the function is implemented internally. Therefore, the functions are divided into two contents: internal implementation and external interface, focusing on the implementation and agreement of shared data between interfaces. This is why we need two files `ERC20.sol` and `IERC20.sol` to implement a contract.

### Event

The `IERC20` defines `2` events: the `Transfer` event and the `Approval` event, which are emitted during token transfers and approvals, respectively.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Triggered when `value` tokens are transferred from `from` to `to`.
     */
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    /**
     * @dev Triggered whenever `value` tokens are approved by `owner` to be spent by `spender`.
     */
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
```

### Functions
`IERC20` defines `6` functions, providing basic functionalities for transferring tokens, and allowing tokens to be approved for use by other third parties on the chain.

- `totalSupply()` returns the total token supply.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Returns the total amount of tokens.
     */
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
```

`balanceOf()` returns the account balance.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.
     */
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
```

- `transfer()` means transfer of funds.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Transfers `amount` tokens from the caller's account to the recipient `to`.
     *
     * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded or not.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.
     */
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
```

The `allowance()` function returns the authorized amount.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Returns the amount authorized by the `owner` account to the `spender` account, default is 0.
     *
     * When {approve} or {transferFrom} is invoked，`allowance` will be changed.
     */
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
```

- `approve()` Authorization

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Allows `spender` to spend `amount` tokens from caller's account.
 *
 * Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded or not.
 *
 * Emits an {Approval} event.
 */
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
```

- `transferFrom()` authorized transfer.

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Transfer `amount` of tokens from `from` account to `to` account, subject to the caller's
 * allowance. The caller must have allowance for `from` account balance.
 *
 * Returns `true` if the operation is successful.
 *
 * Emits a {Transfer} event.
 */
function transferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) external returns (bool);
```

## Implementation of ERC20

Now we will write an `ERC20` contract and implement the functions defined in the `IERC20` interface.

### State Variables
We need state variables to record account balances, allowances, and token information. Among them, `balanceOf`, `allowance`, and `totalSupply` are of type `public`, which will automatically generate a same-name `getter` function, implementing `balanceOf()`, `allowance()` and `totalSupply()` functions defined in `IERC20`. `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` correspond to the name, symbol, and decimal places of tokens.

**Note**: adding `override` modifier to `public` variables will override the same-name `getter` function inherited from the parent contract, such as `balanceOf()` function in `IERC20`.

```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) public override balanceOf;

    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public override allowance;

    uint256 public override totalSupply;   // total supply of the token

    string public name;   // the name of the token
    string public symbol;  // the symbol of the token
    
    uint8 public decimals = 18; // decimal places of the token
```

### Functions
- Constructor Function: Initializes the token name and symbol.

```solidity
    constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_){
        name = name_;
        symbol = symbol_;
    }
```

- `transfer()` function: Implements the `transfer` function in `IERC20`, which handles token transfers. The caller deducts `amount` tokens and the recipient receives the corresponding tokens. Some coins will modify this function to include logic such as taxation, dividends, lottery, etc.

```solidity
    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) external override returns (bool) {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

- `approve()` function: Implements the `approve` function in `IERC20`, which handles token authorization logic. The `spender` specified in the function can spend the authorized `amount` of tokens from the authorizer. The `spender` can be an EOA account or a contract account, for example, when you trade tokens on `Uniswap`, you need to authorize tokens to the `Uniswap` contract.

```solidity
    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external override returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

- `transferFrom()` function: Implements the `transferFrom` function in `IERC20`, which is the logic for authorized transfer. The authorized party transfers `amount` of tokens from `sender` to `recipient`.

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint amount
    ) external override returns (bool) {
        allowance[sender][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

- `mint()` function: Token minting function, not included in the `IERC20` standard. For the sake of the tutorial, anyone can mint any amount of tokens. In actual applications, permission management will be added, and only the `owner` can mint tokens.

```solidity
    function mint(uint amount) external {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
        emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

- `burn()` function: Function to destroy tokens, not included in the `IERC20` standard.

```solidity
    function burn(uint amount) external {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalSupply -= amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), amount);
    }
```

## Issuing ERC20 Tokens

With the `ERC20` standard in place, it is very easy to issue tokens on the `ETH` chain. Now, let's issue our first token.

Compile the `ERC20` contract in `Remix`, enter the constructor's parameters in the deployment section, set `name_` and `symbol_` to `WTF`, and then click the `transact` button to deploy.

![Deploying the contract](./img/31-1.png)

Now, we have created the `WTF` token. We need to run the `mint()` function to mint some tokens for ourselves. Open up the `ERC20` contract in the `Deployed Contract` section, enter `100` in the `mint` function area, and click the `mint` button to mint `100` `WTF` tokens for ourselves.

You can click on the Debug button on the right to view the logs like below.

There are four key pieces of information:
- The `Transfer` event
- The minting address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- The receiving address `0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4`
- The token amount `100`

![Minting tokens](./img/31-2.png)

We use the `balanceOf()` function to check the account balance. By inputting our current account, we can see the balance of our account is `100` which means minting is successful.

The account information is shown on the left like below image, and the details of the function execution are indicated on the right side.

## Summary

In this lesson, we learned about the `ERC20` standard and its implementation on the Ethereum network, and issued our own test token. The `ERC20` token standard proposed at the end of 2015 greatly lowered the threshold for issuing tokens on the Ethereum network and ushered in the era of `ICO`. When investing, carefully read the project's token contract to effectively avoid risks and increase investment success rate.
