In this section, we will introduce control flow in Solidity, and write an insertion sort (`InsertionSort`), a program that looks simple but is actually bug-prone.

## Control Flow

Solidity's control flow is similar to other languages, mainly including the following components:

1. `if-else`

```solidity
function ifElseTest(uint256 _number) public pure returns(bool){
    if(_number == 0){
	return(true);
    }else{
	return(false);
    }
}
```

2. `for loop`

```solidity
function forLoopTest() public pure returns(uint256){
    uint sum = 0;
    for(uint i = 0; i < 10; i++){
	sum += i;
    }
    return(sum);
}
```

3. `while loop`

```solidity
function whileTest() public pure returns(uint256){
    uint sum = 0;
    uint i = 0;
    while(i < 10){
	sum += i;
	i++;
    }
    return(sum);
}
```

4. `do-while loop`

```solidity
function doWhileTest() public pure returns(uint256){
    uint sum = 0;
    uint i = 0;
    do{
	sum += i;
	i++;
    }while(i < 10);
    return(sum);
}
```

5. Conditional (`ternary`) operator

The `ternary` operator is the only operator in Solidity that accepts three operands： a condition followed by a question mark (`?`), then an expression `x` to execute if the condition is true followed by a colon (`:`), and finally the expression `y` to execute if the condition is false: `condition ? x : y`. 

This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an `if-else` statement.

```solidity
// ternary/conditional operator
function ternaryTest(uint256 x, uint256 y) public pure returns(uint256){
    // return the max of x and y
    return x >= y ? x: y; 
}
```

In addition, there are `continue` (immediately enter the next loop) and `break` (break out of the current loop) keywords that can be used.

## `Solidity` Implementation of Insertion Sort

**Note**: Over 90% of people who write the insertion algorithm with Solidity will get it wrong on the first try.

### Insertion Sort

The sorting algorithm solves the problem of arranging an unordered set of numbers from small to large, for example, sorting `[2, 5, 3, 1]` to `[1, 2, 3, 5]`. Insertion Sort (`InsertionSort`) is the simplest and first sorting algorithm that most developers learn in their computer science class. The logic of `InsertionSort`: 

1. from the beginning of the array `x` to the end, compare the element `x[i]` with the element in front of it `x[i-1]`; if `x[i]` is smaller, switch their positions, compare it with `x[i-2]`, and continue this process. 

The schematic of insertion sort:

### Python Implementation

Let's first look at the Python Implementation of the insertion sort：

```python
# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort
def insertionSort(arr):
	for i in range(1, len(arr)):
		key = arr[i]
		j = i-1
		while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :
				arr[j+1] = arr[j]
				j -= 1
		arr[j+1] = key
    return arr
```

### Solidity Implementation (with Bug)

Python version of Insertion Sort takes up 9 lines. Let's rewrite it into Solidity by replacing `functions`, `variables`, and `loops` with solidity syntax accordingly. It only takes up 9 lines of code:

``` solidity
    // Insertion Sort (Wrong version）
    function insertionSortWrong(uint[] memory a) public pure returns(uint[] memory) {
        for (uint i = 1;i < a.length;i++){
            uint temp = a[i];
            uint j=i-1;
            while( (j >= 0) && (temp < a[j])){
                a[j+1] = a[j];
                j--;
            }
            a[j+1] = temp;
        }
        return(a);
    }
```

But when we compile the modified version and try to sort `[2, 5, 3, 1]`. *BOOM!* There are bugs! After 3-hour debugging, I still could not find where the bug was. I googled "Solidity insertion sort", and found that all the insertion algorithms written with Solidity are all wrong, such as [Sorting in Solidity without Comparison](https://medium.com/coinmonks/sorting-in-solidity-without-comparison-4eb47e04ff0d)

Errors occurred in `Remix decoded output`:

### Solidity Implementation (Correct)

With the help of a friend from `Dapp-Learning` community, we finally found the problem. The most commonly used variable type in Solidity is `uint`, which represents a non-negative integer. If it takes a negative value, we will encounter an `underflow` error. In the above code, the variable `j` will get `-1`, causing the bug.

So, we need to add `1` to `j` so it can never take a negative value. The correct insertion sort solidity code:

```solidity
    // Insertion Sort（Correct Version）
    function insertionSort(uint[] memory a) public pure returns(uint[] memory) {
        // note that uint can not take negative value
        for (uint i = 1;i < a.length;i++){
            uint temp = a[i];
            uint j=i;
            while( (j >= 1) && (temp < a[j-1])){
                a[j] = a[j-1];
                j--;
            }
            a[j] = temp;
        }
        return(a);
    }
```

Result:

   !["Input [2,5,3,1] Output[1,2,3,5]"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S-i6rwCMeXoi8eNJ0fRdB.png?height=300&width=554)

## Summary

In this lecture, we introduced control flow in Solidity and wrote a simple but bug-prone sorting algorithm. Solidity looks simple but has many traps. Every month, projects get hacked and lose millions of dollars because of small bugs in the smart contract. To write a safe contract, we need to master the basics of Solidity and keep practising.
