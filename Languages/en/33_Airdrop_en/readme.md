# WTF Solidity Quick Start: 33. Sending Airdrops

Recently, I have been revisiting Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and writing "WTF Solidity" tutorials for newbies.

In the world of cryptocurrency, one of the most exciting things is receiving an airdrop of free tokens. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use a smart contract to send `ERC20` tokens as an airdrop.

## Airdrop 

An airdrop is a marketing strategy used in the cryptocurrency industry where a project distributes tokens for free to a specific group of users. To qualify for an airdrop, users are usually required to complete simple tasks such as testing a product, sharing news, or referring friends. The project gains seed users through the airdrop, while users receive a sum of wealth, making it a win-win situation.

Since there are usually a large number of users receiving an airdrop, it is not practical for the project to send each transfer one by one. By using a smart contract to batch-send `ERC20` tokens, the efficiency of the airdrop can be significantly increased.

### Airdrop Token Contract

The logic of the airdrop contract is simple: by using a loop, a single transaction sends `ERC20` tokens to multiple addresses. The contract contains `2` functions:

- The `getSum()` function: returns the sum of a `uint` array.

    ```solidity
    // sum function for arrays
    function getSum(uint256[] calldata _arr) public pure returns(uint sum)
    {
        for(uint i = 0; i < _arr.length; i++)
            sum = sum + _arr[i];
    }
    ```

- Function `multiTransferToken()`: sends airdrop of `ERC20` tokens, including `3` parameters:
   - `_token`: Address of the token contract (`address` type)
   - `_addresses`: Array of user addresses receiving the airdrop (`address[]` type)
   - `_amounts`: Array of airdrop amounts that correspond to the quantity of each address in `_addresses` (`uint[]` type)

   This function contains `2` checks: The first `require` checks if the length of the `_addresses` array is equal to the length of the `_amounts` array. The second `require` checks if the authorization limit of the airdrop contract is greater than the total amount of tokens to be airdropped.

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer ERC20 tokens to multiple addresses, authorization is required before use
///
/// @param _token The address of ERC20 token for transfer
/// @param _addresses The array of airdrop addresses
/// @param _amounts The array of amount of tokens (airdrop amount for each address)
function multiTransferToken(
    address _token,
    address[] calldata _addresses,
    uint256[] calldata _amounts
    ) external {
    // Check: The length of _addresses array should be equal to the length of _amounts array
    require(_addresses.length == _amounts.length, "Lengths of Addresses and Amounts NOT EQUAL");
    IERC20 token = IERC20(_token); // Declare IERC contract variable
    uint _amountSum = getSum(_amounts); // Calculate the total amount of airdropped tokens
    // Check: The authorized amount of tokens should be greater than or equal to the total amount of airdropped tokens
    require(token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amountSum, "Need Approve ERC20 token");
    
    // for loop, use transferFrom function to send airdrops
    for (uint8 i; i < _addresses.length; i++) {
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, _addresses[i], _amounts[i]);
    }
}
```

- `multiTransferETH()` function: Send `ETH` airdrop, with `2` parameters:
    - `_addresses`: An array of user addresses that receive the airdrop (`address[]` type)
    - `_amounts`: An array of airdrop amounts, corresponding to the quantity for each address in `_addresses` (`uint[]` type)

```solidity
/// Transfer ETH to multiple addresses
function multiTransferETH(
    address payable[] calldata _addresses,
    uint256[] calldata _amounts
) public payable {
    // Check: _addresses and _amounts arrays should have the same length
    require(_addresses.length == _amounts.length, "Lengths of Addresses and Amounts NOT EQUAL");
    // Calculate total amount of ETH to be airdropped
    uint _amountSum = getSum(_amounts);
    // Check: transferred ETH should equal total amount
    require(msg.value == _amountSum, "Transfer amount error");
    // Use a for loop to transfer ETH using transfer function
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addresses.length; i++) {
        _addresses[i].transfer(_amounts[i]);
    }
}
```

### Airdrop Practice

1. Deploy the `ERC20` token contract and mint 10,000 units of the token for yourself.

2. Deploy the `Airdrop` contract.

3. Use the `approve()` function in the `ERC20` contract to grant authorization of 10,000 units of the token to the `Airdrop` contract.

4. Execute the `multiTransferToken()` function in the `Airdrop` contract to perform the airdrop. Set `_token` as the `ERC20` token address, and fill in `_addresses` and `_amounts` as follows:

```
// input _addresses like below
["0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2", "0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4"]

// input _amounts like below
[100, 200]
```

5. Use the `balanceOf()` function of the `ERC20` contract to check the token balance of the user address above. The airdrop is successful if the balance becomes `100` and `200` respectively!

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we introduced how to use `solidity` to write an `ERC20` token airdrop contract, greatly increasing the efficiency of airdrops. The biggest airdrop I ever received was from `ENS`, how about you?
