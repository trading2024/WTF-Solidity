# WTF Solidity Tutorial: 15. Errors

Recently, I have been revisiting Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and writing "WTF Solidity" tutorials for newbies.

In this chapter, we will introduce three ways to throw exceptions in solidity: `error`, `require`, and `assert`.

## Errors
Solidity has many functions for error handling. Errors can occur at compile time or runtime. 

### Error
The `error` statement is a new feature in solidity `0.8`. It saves gas and informs users why the operation failed. It is the recommended way to throw errors in solidity.
Custom errors are defined using the error statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts. Below, we created a `TransferNotOwner` error, which will throw an error when the caller is not the token `owner` during the transfer:

```solidity
error TransferNotOwner(); // custom error
```

In functions, `error` must be used together with the `revert` statement.

```solidity
function transferOwner1(uint256 tokenId, address newOwner) public {
    if(_owners[tokenId] != msg.sender){
        revert TransferNotOwner();
    }
    _owners[tokenId] = newOwner;
}
```
The `transferOwner1()` function will check if the caller is the owner of the token; if not, it will throw a `TransferNotOwner` error and revert the transaction.

### Require
The `require` statement was the most commonly used method for error handling prior to solidity `0.8`. It is still popular among developers. 

Syntax of `require`: 
```
require(condition, "error message");
```

An exception will be thrown when the condition is not met.

Despite its simplicity, the gas consumption is higher than  `error` statement: the gas consumption grows linearly as the length of the error message increases. 

Now, let's rewrite the above `transferOwner` function with the `require` statement:
```solidity
function transferOwner2(uint256 tokenId, address newOwner) public {
    require(_owners[tokenId] == msg.sender, "Transfer Not Owner");
    _owners[tokenId] = newOwner;
}
```

### Assert
The `assert` statement is generally used for debugging purposes because it does not include an error message to inform the user.
Syntax of `assert`: 
```solidity
assert(condition);
```
If the condition is not met, an error will be thrown.

Let's rewrite the `transferOwner` function with the `assert` statement:
```solidity
    function transferOwner3(uint256 tokenId, address newOwner) public {
        assert(_owners[tokenId] == msg.sender);
        _owners[tokenId] = newOwner;
    }
```

## Remix Demo
After deploying `Error` contract.

1. `error`: Enter a `uint256` number and a non-zero address, and call the `transferOwner1()` function. The console will throw a custom `TransferNotOwner` error.

2. `require`: Enter a `uint256` number and a non-zero address, and call the `transferOwner2()` function. The console will throw an error and output the error message `"Transfer Not Owner"`.

3. `assert`: Enter a `uint256` number and non-zero address and call the `transferOwner3` function. The console will throw an error without any error messages.

## Gas Comparison
Let's compare the gas consumption of `error`, `require`, and `assert`. 
You can find the gas consumption for each function call with the Debug button of the remix console:

1. **gas for `error`**：24457 `wei`
2. **gas for `require`**：24755 `wei`
3. **gas for `assert`**：24473 `wei`

We can see that the `error` consumes the least gas, followed by the `assert`, while the `require` consumes the most gas!
Therefore, `error` not only informs the user of the error message but also saves gas.

## Summary
In this chapter, we introduced 3 statements to handle errors in Solidity: `error`, `require`, and `assert`. After comparing their gas consumption, the `error` statement is the cheapest, while `require` has the highest gas consumption.
