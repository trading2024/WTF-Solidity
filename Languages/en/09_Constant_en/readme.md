# WTF Solidity Tutorial: 9. Constant and Immutable

Recently, I have been revisiting Solidity, consolidating the finer details, and writing "WTF Solidity" tutorials for newbies.

In this section, we will introduce two keywords to restrict modifications to their state in Solidity: `constant` and `immutable`. If a state variable is declared with `constant` or `immutable`, its value cannot be modified after contract compilation.

Value-typed variables can be declared as `constant` and `immutable`; `string` and `bytes` can be declared as `constant`, but not `immutable`.

## constant and immutable

### constant

The `constant` variable must be initialized during declaration and cannot be changed afterwards. Any modification attempt will result in an error at compilation. 

``` solidity
    // The constant variable must be initialized when declared and cannot be changed after that
    uint256 constant CONSTANT_NUM = 10;
    string constant CONSTANT_STRING = "0xAA";
    bytes constant CONSTANT_BYTES = "WTF";
    address constant CONSTANT_ADDRESS = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000;
```

### Immutable

The `immutable` variable can be initialized during declaration or in the constructor, which is more flexible.

``` solidity
    // The immutable variable can be initialized in the constructor and cannot be changed later
    uint256 public immutable IMMUTABLE_NUM = 9999999999;
    address public immutable IMMUTABLE_ADDRESS;
    uint256 public immutable IMMUTABLE_BLOCK;
    uint256 public immutable IMMUTABLE_TEST;
```

You can initialize the `immutable` variable using a global variable such as `address(this)`, `block.number`, or a custom function. In the following example, we use the `test()` function to initialize the `IMMUTABLE_TEST` variable to a value of `9`:

``` solidity
    // The immutable variables are initialized with the constructor, that is:
    constructor(){
        IMMUTABLE_ADDRESS = address(this);
        IMMUTABLE_BLOCK = block.number;
        IMMUTABLE_TEST = test();
    }

    function test() public pure returns(uint256){
        uint256 what = 9;
        return(what);
    }
```


## Verify on Remix

1. After the contract is deployed, You can obtain the values of the `constant` and `immutable` variables through the `getter` function.

2. After the `constant` variable is initialized, any attempt to change its value will result. In the example, the compiler throws: `TypeError: Cannot assign to a constant variable.`

   ![9-2.png](./img/9-2.png)   
   
3. After the `immutable` variable is initialized, any attempt to change its value will result. In the example, the compiler throws: `TypeError: Immutable state variable already initialized.`

## Summary

In this section, we introduced two keywords to restrict modifications to their state in Solidity: `constant` and `immutable`. They keep the variables that should not be changed unchanged. It will help to save `gas` while improving the contract's security.
